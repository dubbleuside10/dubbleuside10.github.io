<h1> Who is Wes Whiteside?</h1>

  <!-- Comment: If you are a kid under 13, never share your first and last name in a public web page. Safety first! -->
  
  <p>I grew up in Auburn Hills, Michigan. I am a graduate of Gannon University in Erie, PA, with a degree in Communications Arts (2006). I was able to receive a scholarship to play football at Gannon as well.
  <p>After graduating from Gannon, I worked in their office of admissions until November of 2009. I then moved to Syracuse and worked in the office of admissions at Syracuse University. After serving in various positions: academic advising (Newhouse School), career exploration specialist (Central Career Services) and undergraduate recruiter (Newhouse), I now serve as the Associate Director in the Office of Community, Culture and Engagement at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. I have worked at Syracuse for over 15 years!</p>
